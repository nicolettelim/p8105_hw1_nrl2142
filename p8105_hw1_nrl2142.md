# Problem 1

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(moderndive)
```

# Short Description of the Dataset

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

This dataset contains 358 rows and 15 columns. There are 15 variables
such as: **origin**: site where weather was recorded. **year, month,
day, hour, time_hour**: date and time information for each observation.
**temp**: temperature in Farenheit. **humid**: humidity (percentage).
**wind_dir**: wind direction in degrees. **wind_speed**: wind speed in
mph. **wind_gust**: maximum wind gust in mph. **precip**: precipitation
in inches. **pressure**: atmospheric pressure in millibars. **visib**:
visibility in miles. The mean temperature is 39.5821229 farenheit.

# Making a Scatterplot

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather,
       aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "Temperature vs Time (colored by Humidity) in Janaury 2013",
    x = "Time (hourly)",
    y = "Temperature (Farenheit)",
    color = "Humidity (%)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

# Description of Scatterplot

There isn’t a clear linear relationship between temperature and humidity
from the scatterplot. However, lower temperatures are often associated
with lower humidity levels as represented by the darker colors in the
scatterplot.

# Export the Scatterplot

``` r
ggsave(filename = "temp_vs_time_scatter.png")
```

# Problem 2

# Creating the Dataframe

``` r
num <- rnorm(10)
is_pos <- num > 0
color <- c("yellow","blue","green","yellow","red","blue","purple","green","yellow","red")
tier <- factor(c("low","med","high","low","med","high","low","med","high","low"),levels = c("low,","med","high"))

df <- tibble(num = num, is_pos = is_pos, color = color, tier = tier)
```

# Trying to take the means of each variable

``` r
mean(pull(df,num))
```

    ## [1] 0.07462564

``` r
mean(pull(df, is_pos))
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
mean(pull(df,color))
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(df,tier))
```

    ## [1] NA

# Writeup

Character variable `color` and factor variable `tier` gives errors when
trying to take the mean. However, numeric mean 0.0746256 and logical
mean 0.5 works.

# Trying coercion with `as.numeric()`

``` r
as.numeric(df$is_pos)
as.numeric(df$color)
as.numeric(df$tier)
as.numeric(df$color)
```

# What happens and why? Is the mean still meaningful?

Character variables produce NA and gives a warning message. This is
because “yellow” does not have a numeric representation so R can’t turn
it into a number. Factors work and according to Google, it’s because
they are assigned integer codes (1,2,3) and the mean just ends up being
the average code. Taking the means of these codes will no have real
meaning in the context of categories unless if it is being used to
describe severity. According to Google, in R, TRUE is internally stored
as 1 and FALSE as 0 so coercing to numeric will just reveal this
encoding. Taking the mean will explain what happens as the mean of the
logical vector will still give us the proportion of TRUE values.
